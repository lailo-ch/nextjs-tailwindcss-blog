As you might already know, I love coding and designing.
I couldn't help myself but use the powerful SwiftUI framework and build an iOS game with playful animations.

# Learning Resources

I started looking into SwiftUI the day it was released. I started with Apple's own tutorials.

A couple of days later, I discovered [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) on Twitter.
There, I learned a lot about SwiftUI and its API, but couldn't find as much as I wanted about animations and transitions.
Meanwhile you can find a complete list called [SwiftUI By Example](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui).

To dive deeper into animations and transitions, I went back to my trusted design tutorial source [Design+Code](https://designcode.io/).

# Design

I stared designing in Sketch to get a feeling of how the game would be. After some iterations, I had something I could start coding in Xcode.

## Colors

Besides the gray colors, I used the default iOS colors `Color.pink`, `Color.orange`, `Color.green` and `Color.blue`.

## Icons

I used the new iOS icons font introduced with iOS 13 called _SF Symbols_.
The leaderboard is the only icon I designed myself, which is exported as _PDF_ to be used as a vector.

# Developement

After exporting the one icon and the gray colors to the `Assets.xcassets`, I was ready to start coding in Xcode.

I strongly believe that if a UI feels wrong, it's not going to be used. That's why I started with the UI and animations first.
It took me some time until I had something I felt was the right amount of animations and types of transitions.

After the UI and animations, I added the state management using the _Combine_ framework.
Adding the leaderboard by using Game Center, was the last bit i did before I started beta testing.

Don't forget to give me your feedback. It helps me to improve the game so you can have even more fun.
